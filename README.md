# PageBotExamples Version 0.5

## What are PageBotExamples

PageBotExamples contain a wide range of example Python scripts and applications. See the respository TypeNetwork/PageBot for the library.

## Examples to be expected

Durin the early staged of PageBot development, many structural changes have been made. The last one dates back November 2017, when we decided to make the connection to DrawBotApp optional. Other drawing environment should be made possible too, such as Flat.

Especially that last change – adding a “Context” – made many of the examples break, and currently we are still working backwards to make them compatible and running again.

To avoid confusion only the working examles will be published in this repository, for now leaving is more empty than intended.

Examples of PageBot generated documents are in the range of:

* Books
* TypeSpecimens
* Magazines
* Newspapers
* Portfolios
* Posters
* Thesis
* Websites

## Repository

The **.gitignore** file for GitHub has been set not commit **_local** and **_export** folders. This way changes in scripts-not-yet-working and local generated documents will not upload to GitHub.

In well written PageBot scrtips the **_export** folder is automatically generated.
